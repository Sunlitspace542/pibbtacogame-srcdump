Baja Bill is one hungry dude.  He's part 
of an exploration team that has discovered 
the ruins of an ancient civilization.  
Tired and hungry from a day of hacking 
through the jungle, he climbs into his 
sleeping bag under a palm tree near the 
giant stone steps that lead up to the main 
temple in the ruins.  In his dreams, the 
temple turns into a bonanza of Taco Bell® 
food delights.  He races from room to room 
through the temple gobbling up as much Taco 
Bell® food as he can.  But there's a catch.  
Hiding in the nooks and crannies of the temple 
are poisonous jungle cobras and scorpions.  
Just when you least expect it, they jump out and 
take a bite!  Cover them with Hot Sauce and they're 
goners.  But if you don't move quickly, they'll 
give you a nasty bite.  


HINT:  Look for hidden keys, crowbars, and a secret
door to reveal hidden passages.  You can also jump
into the water and swim underneath it for added 
adventure.
